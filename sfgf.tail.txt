Inputs:
	Percent(Numeric),
	RangeLength(Numeric);

Variables:
	RPOpen(0.0),
	RPClose(0.0),
	RPAve(0.0),
	RangeHigh(0.0),
	RangeLow(0.0),
	RP25(0.25),
	RP50(0.50);

RPOpen = sfgf.rangepct(Open, High, Low);
RPClose = sfgf.rangepct(Close, High, Low);
RPAve = (RPOpen + RPClose) / 2;
RangeHigh = Highest(High, RangeLength);
RangeLow = Lowest(Low, RangeLength);

Condition1 = RPAve >= (1 - Percent);
Condition2 = RPClose >= (1 - RP25);
If (Condition1 or Condition2) and
Low < Lowest(Low, RangeLength - 1)[1] and
sfgf.rangepct(Low, RangeHigh, RangeLow) <= Percent and
RPOpen > RP50 and
RPClose > RP50 Then
	sfgf.tail = 1;

Condition1 = RPAve <= Percent;
Condition2 = RPClose <= RP25;
If (Condition1 or Condition2) and
High > Highest(High, RangeLength - 1)[1] and
sfgf.rangepct(High, RangeHigh, RangeLow) >= (1 - Percent) and
RPOpen < RP50 and
RPClose < RP50 Then
	sfgf.tail = 2;
