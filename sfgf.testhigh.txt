Inputs:
	Length(Numeric),
	SeparationBars(Numeric),
	ATRFactor(Numeric);

Variables:
	High2(0);

sfgf.testhigh = -1;
High2 = NthHighestBar(2, High, Length);
If High >= Highest(High, Length - 1)[1] and
High2 >= SeparationBars and
AbsValue(High - High[High2]) <= ATRFactor * Volatility(Length) and
Close < High[High2] Then
	sfgf.testhigh = High2;
