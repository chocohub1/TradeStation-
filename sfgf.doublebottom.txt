Inputs:
	LookbackBars(Numeric),
	Strength(Numeric),
	RangeFactor(Numeric);

Variables:
	RangeDelta(0.0),
	HighPivot(0.0),
	LowPivot(0.0),
	LowMinimum(7);

sfgf.doublebottom = -1;
RangeDelta = RangeFactor * Volatility(LookbackBars);
HighPivot = PivotHighVSBar(1, High, Strength, Strength, LookbackBars);
LowPivot = PivotLowVSBar(1, Low, Strength, Strength, LookbackBars);

If HighPivot <> -1 and
LowPivot <> -1 and
LowPivot >= LowMinimum and
AbsValue(Low - Low[LowPivot]) <= RangeDelta and
AbsValue(Low - Lowest(Low, LowPivot)) <= RangeDelta and
HighPivot < LowPivot and
Low <= Low[1] Then
	sfgf.doublebottom = LowPivot;
